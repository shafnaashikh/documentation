            <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
            <p>Facebook is an online social media and social networking service owned by American company Meta Platforms. Founded in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg with fellow Harvard College students and roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, its name comes from the face book directories often given to American university students. Membership was initially limited to Harvard students, gradually expanding to other North American universities and, since 2006, anyone over 13 years old. As of July 2022, Facebook claimed 2.93 billion monthly active users,[6] and ranked third worldwide among the most visited websites as of July 2022.[7] It was the most downloaded mobile app of the 2010s.[8]

                Facebook can be accessed from devices with Internet connectivity, such as personal computers, tablets and smartphones. After registering, users can create a profile revealing information about themselves. They can post text, photos and multimedia which are shared with any other users who have agreed to be their "friend" or, with different privacy settings, publicly. Users can also communicate directly with each other with Facebook Messenger, join common-interest groups, and receive notifications on the activities of their Facebook friends and the pages they follow.
                
                The subject of numerous controversies, Facebook has often been criticized over issues such as user privacy (as with the Cambridge Analytica data scandal), political manipulation (as with the 2016 U.S. elections) and mass surveillance.[9] Posts originating from the Facebook page of Breitbart News, a media organization previously affiliated with Cambridge Analytica, are currently among the most widely shared political content on Facebook.[10][11][12][13][14] Facebook has also been subject to criticism over psychological effects such as addiction and low self-esteem, and various controversies over content such as fake news, conspiracy theories, copyright infringement, and hate speech.[15] Commentators have accused Facebook of willingly facilitating the spread of such content,[16][17][18][19][20][21] as well as exaggerating its number of users to appeal to advertisers</p>

<div class="history" id="first">
    <h2>History</h2>
<P>Zuckerberg built a website called "Facemash" in 2003 while attending Harvard University. The site was comparable to Hot or Not and used "photos compiled from the online face books of nine Houses, placing two next to each other at a time and asking users to choose the "hotter" person".[24] Facemash attracted 450 visitors and 22,000 photo-views in its first four hours.[25] The site was sent to several campus group listservs, but was shut down a few days later by Harvard administration. Zuckerberg faced expulsion and was charged with breaching security, violating copyrights and violating individual privacy. Ultimately, the charges were dropped.[24] Zuckerberg expanded on this project that semester by creating a social study tool. He uploaded art images, each accompanied by a comments section, to a website he shared with his classmates.[26]

    A "face book" is a student directory featuring photos and personal information.[25] In 2003, Harvard had only a paper version[27] along with private online directories.[24][28] Zuckerberg told The Harvard Crimson, "Everyone's been talking a lot about a universal face book within Harvard. ... I think it's kind of silly that it would take the University a couple of years to get around to it. I can do it better than they can, and I can do it in a week."[28] In January 2004, Zuckerberg coded a new website, known as "TheFacebook", inspired by a Crimson editorial about Facemash, stating, "It is clear that the technology needed to create a centralized Website is readily available ... the benefits are many." Zuckerberg met with Harvard student Eduardo Saverin, and each of them agreed to invest $1,000 ($1,435 in 2021 dollars[29]) in the site.[30] On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched "TheFacebook", originally located at thefacebook.com.[31]
    
    
    Mark Zuckerberg, co-creator of Facebook, in his Harvard dorm room, 2005
    Six days after the site launched, Harvard seniors Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra accused Zuckerberg of intentionally misleading them into believing that he would help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com. They claimed that he was instead using their ideas to build a competing product.[32] The three complained to the Crimson and the newspaper began an investigation. They later sued Zuckerberg, settling in 2008[33] for 1.2 million shares (worth $300 million ($354 million in 2021 dollars[29]) at Facebook's IPO).[34]
    
    Membership was initially restricted to students of Harvard College. Within a month, more than half the undergraduates had registered.[35] Dustin Moskovitz, Andrew McCollum, and Chris Hughes joined Zuckerberg to help manage the growth of the website.[36] In March 2004, Facebook expanded to Columbia, Stanford and Yale.[37] It then became available to all Ivy League colleges, Boston University, NYU, MIT, and successively most universities in the United States and Canada.[38][39]
    
    In mid-2004, Napster co-founder and entrepreneur Sean Parker—an informal advisor to Zuckerberg—became company president.[40] In June 2004, the company moved to Palo Alto, California.[41] It received its first investment later that month from PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel.[42] In 2005, the company dropped "the" from its name after purchasing the domain name Facebook.com for US$200,000 ($277,492 in 2021 dollars[29]).[43] The domain had belonged to AboutFace Corporation.
    
    In May 2005, Accel Partners invested $12.7 million ($17.6 million in 2021 dollars[29]) in Facebook, and Jim Breyer[44] added $1 million ($1.39 million in 2021 dollars[29]) of his own money. A high-school version of the site launched in September 2005.[45] Eligibility expanded to include employees of several companies, including Apple Inc. and Microsoft.</P>

    <h2>Growth</h2>
<P>In May 2006, Facebook hired its first intern, Julie Zhuo.[47] After a month, Zhuo was hired as a full-time engineer.[47] On September 26, 2006, Facebook opened to everyone at least 13 years old with a valid email address.[48][49][50] By late 2007, Facebook had 100,000 pages on which companies promoted themselves.[51] Organization pages began rolling out in May 2009.[52] On October 24, 2007, Microsoft announced that it had purchased a 1.6% share of Facebook for $240 million ($314 million in 2021 dollars[29]), giving Facebook a total implied value of around $15 billion ($19.6 billion in 2021 dollars[29]). Microsoft's purchase included rights to place international advertisements.[53][54]

    In May 2007, at the first f8 developers conference, Facebook announced the launch of the Facebook Developer Platform, providing a framework for software developers to create applications that interact with core Facebook features. By the second annual f8 developers conference on July 23, 2008, the number of applications on the platform had grown to 33,000, and the number of registered developers had exceeded 400,000.[55]
    
    The website won awards such as placement into the "Top 100 Classic Websites" by PC Magazine in 2007,[56] and winning the "People's Voice Award" from the Webby Awards in 2008.[57]
    
    On July 20, 2008, Facebook introduced "Facebook Beta", a significant redesign of its user interface on selected networks. The Mini-Feed and Wall were consolidated, profiles were separated into tabbed sections, and an effort was made to create a cleaner look.[58] Facebook began migrating users to the new version in September 2008.[59]
    
    In October 2008, Facebook announced that its international headquarters would locate in Dublin, Ireland.[60] In September 2009, Facebook said that it had achieved positive cash flow for the first time.[61] A January 2009 Compete.com study ranked Facebook the most used social networking service by worldwide monthly active users.[62][better source needed] China blocked Facebook in 2009 following the Ürümqi riots.[63]
    
    In 2010, Facebook won the Crunchie "Best Overall Startup Or Product" award[64] for the third year in a row.[65]
    
    The company announced 500 million users in July 2010.[66] Half of the site's membership used Facebook daily, for an average of 34 minutes, while 150 million users accessed the site from mobile devices. A company representative called the milestone a "quiet revolution."[67] In October 2010 groups were introduced.[68] In November 2010, based on SecondMarket Inc. (an exchange for privately held companies' shares), Facebook's value was $41 billion ($50.9 billion in 2021 dollars[29]). The company had slightly surpassed eBay to become the third largest American web company after Google and Amazon.com.[69][70]
    
    On November 15, 2010, Facebook announced it had acquired the domain name fb.com from the American Farm Bureau Federation for an undisclosed amount. On January 11, 2011, the Farm Bureau disclosed $8.5 million ($10.2 million in 2021 dollars[29]) in "domain sales income", making the acquisition of FB.com one of the ten highest domain sales in history.[71]
    
    In February 2011, Facebook announced plans to move its headquarters to the former Sun Microsystems campus in Menlo Park, California.[72][73] In March 2011, it was reported that Facebook was removing about 20,000 profiles daily for violations such as spam, graphic content and underage use, as part of its efforts to boost cyber security.[74] Statistics showed that Facebook reached one trillion page views in the month of June 2011, making it the most visited website tracked by DoubleClick.[75][76] According to a Nielsen study, Facebook had in 2011 become the second-most accessed website in the U.S. behind Google.</p>

    Facebook's initial public offering came on May 17, 2012, at a share price of US$38 ($45.00 in 2021 dollars[29]). The company was valued at $104 billion ($123 billion in 2021 dollars[29]), the largest valuation to that date.[80][81][82] The IPO raised $16 billion ($18.9 billion in 2021 dollars[29]), the third-largest in U.S. history, after Visa Inc. in 2008 and AT&T Wireless in 2000.[83][84] Based on its 2012 income of $5 billion ($5.9 billion in 2021 dollars[29]), Facebook joined the Fortune 500 list for the first time in May 2013, ranked 462.[85] The shares set a first-day record for trading volume of an IPO (460 million shares).[86] The IPO was controversial given the immediate price declines that followed,[87][88][89][90] and was the subject of lawsuits,[91] while SEC and FINRA both launched investigations.[92]
    
    Zuckerberg announced at the start of October 2012 that Facebook had one billion monthly active users,[93] including 600 million mobile users, 219 billion photo uploads and 140 billion friend connections.</p>

    <h2>Messaging</h2>

<p>Facebook Messenger is an instant messaging service and software application. It began as Facebook Chat in 2008,[273] was revamped in 2010[274] and eventually became a standalone mobile app in August 2011, while remaining part of the user page on browsers.[275]

    Complementing regular conversations, Messenger lets users make one-to-one[276] and group[277] voice[278] and video calls.[279] Its Android app has integrated support for SMS[280] and "Chat Heads", which are round profile photo icons appearing on-screen regardless of what app is open,[281] while both apps support multiple accounts,[282] conversations with optional end-to-end encryption[283] and "Instant Games".[284] Some features, including sending money[285] and requesting transportation,[286] are limited to the United States.[285] In 2017, Facebook added "Messenger Day", a feature that lets users share photos and videos in a story-format with all their friends with the content disappearing after 24 hours;[287] Reactions, which lets users tap and hold a message to add a reaction through an emoji;[288] and Mentions, which lets users in group conversations type @ to give a particular user a notification.[288]
    
    Businesses and users can interact through Messenger with features such as tracking purchases and receiving notifications, and interacting with customer service representatives. Third-party developers can integrate apps into Messenger, letting users enter an app while inside Messenger and optionally share details from the app into a chat.[289] Developers can build chatbots into Messenger, for uses such as news publishers building bots to distribute news.[290] The M virtual assistant (U.S.) scans chats for keywords and suggests relevant actions, such as its payments system for users mentioning money.[291][292] Group chatbots appear in Messenger as "Chat Extensions". A "Discovery" tab allows finding bots, and enabling special, branded QR codes that, when scanned, take the user to a specific bot.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Facebook has faced a steady stream of controversies over how it handles user privacy, repeatedly adjusting its privacy settings and policies.[364]

        In 2010, the US National Security Agency began taking publicly posted profile information from Facebook, among other social media services.[365]
        
        On November 29, 2011, Facebook settled Federal Trade Commission charges that it deceived consumers by failing to keep privacy promises.[366] In August 2013 High-Tech Bridge published a study showing that links included in Facebook messaging service messages were being accessed by Facebook.[367] In January 2014 two users filed a lawsuit against Facebook alleging that their privacy had been violated by this practice.[368]
        
        On June 7, 2018, Facebook announced that a bug had resulted in about 14 million Facebook users having their default sharing setting for all new posts set to "public".[369]
        
        On April 4, 2019, half a billion records of Facebook users were found exposed on Amazon cloud servers, containing information about users' friends, likes, groups, and checked-in locations, as well as names, passwords and email addresses.[370]
        
        The phone numbers of at least 200 million Facebook users were found to be exposed on an open online database in September 2019. They included 133 million US users, 18 million from the UK, and 50 million from users in Vietnam. After removing duplicates, the 419 million records have been reduced to 219 million. The database went offline after TechCrunch contacted the web host. It is thought the records were amassed using a tool that Facebook disabled in April 2018 after the Cambridge Analytica controversy. A Facebook spokeswoman said in a statement: "The dataset is old and appears to have information obtained before we made changes last year...There is no evidence that Facebook accounts were compromised."[371]
        
        Facebook's privacy problems resulted in companies like Viber Media and Mozilla discontinuing advertising on Facebook's platforms.</p>
